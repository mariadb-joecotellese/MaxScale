/** Smart query test.
 *
 *  Since there is no columnstore support in the system-test yet, this code
 *  makes sure that when a query has been executed once, the subsequent runs
 *  of the same query are executed on the same server.
 *
 *  The setup is such that there are multiple ReadWriteSplits, each with a
 *  single server, where these RWS:s are the "servers" of the SmartRouter.
 *
 *  Caveat: This test assumes that the servers are (nearly) identical, which
 *          they are in system-test. If one server is much faster than the
 *          others this test might not find a problem even if there is one.
