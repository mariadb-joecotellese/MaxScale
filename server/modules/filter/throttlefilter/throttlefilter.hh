    mxs::config::Milliseconds throttling_duration;  // .. for this long before disconnect.
    mxs::config::Milliseconds continuous_duration;  // What time window is considered continuous meddling.

    // Example: max 100qps and sampling 5s. As soon as more than 500 queries are made in less
    // then any 5s period throttling is triggered (because 501 > 100qps * 5 s). But also note
    // that qps can stay at 200qps for 2.5s before throttling starts.

    // Once throttling has started a countdown for the throttling_duration is started. Throttling
    // is stopped if the qps stays below max_qps for continuous_duration. If throttling continues
    // for more than throttling_duration, the session is disconnected.

    // TODO: this should probably depend on overall activity. If this is to protect the
    // database, multiple sessions gone haywire will still cause problems. It would be quite
    // easy to add a counter into the filter to measure overall qps. On the other hand, if
    // a single session is active, it should be allowed to run at whatever the absolute
    // allowable speed is.
